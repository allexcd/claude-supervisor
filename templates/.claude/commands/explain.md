Explain the code or file the user is asking about. Structure your explanation as:

1. **What it does** — a one-paragraph plain-English summary
2. **Why it exists** — the problem it solves, and why this approach was chosen over alternatives
3. **How it works** — a step-by-step walkthrough of the key logic
4. **How it fits in** — what calls it, what it calls, and where it sits in the broader system
5. **Gotchas** — non-obvious behaviour, edge cases, or things that will confuse a newcomer

If the code is complex, include an ASCII diagram showing the data flow or call chain.

Do not suggest improvements or refactors. The goal is understanding, not critique.
