# Claude Supervisor — Tasks Config
#
# Each [task] block defines one agent. Only `prompt` is required.
# Omit any other field to use defaults or be prompted interactively.
#
#   [task]
#   prompt = description of the task
#   branch = optional branch name   (default: auto-generated from prompt)
#   model  = optional model ID      (default: prompted interactively)
#   mode   = normal | plan           (default: normal)
#
# Recommended workflow for complex features:
#   1. A plan-mode agent writes the implementation plan
#   2. A plan-mode reviewer checks it as a staff engineer
#   3. Normal-mode workers execute once the plan is approved

# --- Plan phase ---

[task]
mode   = plan
prompt = review the codebase and write a detailed implementation plan for the feature

[task]
mode   = plan
prompt = review the above plan as a staff engineer and flag risks or missing steps

# --- Execution phase (uncomment and edit after approving the plan) ---

# [task]
# branch = feature-auth
# model  = claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
# prompt = implement the feature per the approved plan

# [task]
# branch = fix-login-bug
# model  = claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
# prompt = fix the login session timeout bug

# [task]
# prompt = refactor the database layer to use connection pooling
